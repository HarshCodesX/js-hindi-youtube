# javascript and classes
```
No classes were not there and technically at present, still there are no classes.

But if we google it, some articles will say that "yes JS have classes and this feature was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (reffered as ES6)"

However it is important to note that JS is primarily a prototype-based language, not object-oriented nor functional based language, everything is prototype based.

It's classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype based inheritance mechanism, so you don't miss out any thing.

## OOP
```
OOP is a programming paradigm i.e "what is the structure of writing code, or style preference of writing code (style such as: procedural, OOP, functional, etc)"
```

## Object
```
Object - collection of properties(variabes, constants, or key value pairs) and methods (functions)
```

## Why use OOP?
```
code was getting mess up that no chunk of code couldn't be reused, but after OOP introduction in JS, we are able to used features of other languages such as Java and c++ 

(we are able to utilize features such as encapsulation, inheritence, and polymorphism, which makes code more modular, reuseable, and easier to maintain. OOP alows us to create classes and instances, similar to java and c++.)
```

## Parts of OOP
```
Object literal
constructor function
classes
Instances (new, this)
```

## 4 Pillars
```
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
